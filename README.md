#  CafÃ© in Los Angeles â€” A Data-Driven Feasibility Study

Welcome to the future of coffee! This project explores whether launching a **robot-staffed cafÃ©** in the heart of Los Angeles is a brilliant idea (spoiler alert: it just might be). Using real-world data and a healthy dose of Python-powered curiosity, this study digs into LAâ€™s food and beverage landscape to see how our cafÃ© concept stacks up.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s This About?

In a city buzzing with food trends, we're thinking about opening a small cafÃ© where the servers areâ€¦ **robots**. Cool, right? But cool doesn't always mean viable. So before pitching this to investors, we asked the right questions:

- What types of food businesses dominate in LA?
- How big are they, really?
- Where are the busiest streets for dining?
- Are franchises still hot?
- How much seating is *too much* seating?

This project is a full analysis of Los Angelesâ€™ dining business environment, especially through the lens of launching a tech-savvy, robot-run cafÃ©.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Looked into types of food businesses, seating capacities, franchise proportions, and more.

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
  Nulls handled, snake_case engaged, street names parsed â€” the usual wrangling magic.

- **Location Intelligence**  
  Identified top streets for potential foot traffic and high-density dining zones.

- **Seating Distribution Analysis**  
  From compact cafÃ©s to giant restaurants â€” how many seats are enough?
